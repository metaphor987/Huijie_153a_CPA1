# ReadingApp

Description:
This is an App for users who love reading. 
Users can write some book reviews, where the information such as the book name, the content of review and date of writing will be stored. Users can also add books to a wish list so that they can find them in the future. Data for different purposes(books reviews vs wish lists) and for different users will be stored separately. This means that deleting only the book review data for one user will not affect all other data. The username can also be stored in the “previous username” place as a reminder, and this is a separate storage, so removing a username from memory will not delete all his/her data. Thank you!
